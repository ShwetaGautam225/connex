        We are a team of IT professionals with years of experience in the tech
        industry. Based in Mohali, we founded Connex Infotech to bridge the gap
        between academic learning and real-world industry experience.
      </p>
      <p className="">
        After running our own successful IT company and working on high-profile
        projects, we noticed a recurring challenge — freshers struggle to gain
        practical exposure. Many leave institutes and academies without the
        skills needed to thrive in a real work environment.

      <p>
        To solve this, we created a hands-on internship program that gives
        aspiring developers real project experience, mentorship from
        professionals, and a clear path to enter the IT industry.
